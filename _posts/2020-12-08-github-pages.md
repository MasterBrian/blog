## Welcome To Your Website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MasterBrian/masterbrian.github.io/edit/gh-pages/_posts/2020-12-08-github-pages.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Zaz: I encourage you to click into the editor link and play around with the posts. Once you get a feel for the format, you're more than welcome to delete this Welcome post, as you won't really need it.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

Zaz: For a terrible example of what blog posts look like, check out this [Test Blog Post](http://masterbrian.com/2020/12/09/bloggy-blog.html).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MasterBrian/blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

Zaz: I chose a default theme for you (Cayman), but have since updated it to provide a more personal look and feel. If you try to change the theme, it will almost defnitely break things. Let me know if you want anything to look a little different and I can work on that.
