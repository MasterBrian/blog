# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *. You can use Markdown most places around GitHub using files with the .md or .markdown extension.

# Syntax guide

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers
```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```

## Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

## Lists

### Unordered
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

### Ordered
```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

## Images
```
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
```

## Links
```
http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

## Blockquotes
```
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

## Inline code
```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```

## Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with GitHub Flavored Markdown:
```
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
```

You can also simply indent your code by four spaces:
```
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
```

Here’s an example of Python code without syntax highlighting:
```
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

## Task Lists
```
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests!

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

```
| First Header | Second Header |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Content from cell 1 |	Content from cell 2 |
| Content in the first column |	Content in the second column |
```

Would become:

| First Header |	Second Header |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Content from cell 1 |	Content from cell 2 |
| Content in the first column |	Content in the second column |

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
