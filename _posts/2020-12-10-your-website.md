# Welcome To Your Website

Here is the system I came up with. 

Facebook is one of many examples of the places you _could_ use. Opening any text editor would allow you to record information there. However, in order to actually facilitate writing, I also needed to provide some tools to make it simple and convenient. The notebook is part of that. Three critical sections are included:
1) One Line Per Day: Which offers a section to create promps and fill them in, one line per day. I've used this for recording memories I didn't want to forget and for generating project ideas.
2) Habit Tracker: This reason I got you this specific notebook. We've talked about this before as something Jerry Seinfeld did for writing his comedy. Forcing him to continue daily. Turns out, that's based on some psychology work done back in the 60's around morning good habits. Simply list the 'habits' you want to track. These can be any actionalble item. Then mark each day you complete it. 
3) Notebook Section: I would recommend this as your rough draft area. It creates a simple source to scribble any though you have. And easily review your last thoughts the next time you open it up. This can help create a kind of continuous momentum if that helps. If not, it's easy to use however you like. 

You may ask at this point, why not use a computer (written ironically as I move these words from my notebook to this site). Sure, you already have social media and probably OneNote or Google Docs. The issue with these is that computer are static. Because of that, no technology today is as versatile as pen and paper. No computer allows you to write and then draw something accurately on a single page without having to swtich from keyboard to stylus over mutliple apps. Computers also require that you remember when and where you wrote something. Notebooks are easier. It's all in one place, written out sequentially, organized further by the index. The biggest benefit I find though is that you can record an idea as you're having it, in the exact way you're thinkg of it. You don't have to conform to an existing apps structure. Notebooks are amazing at capturing unstructured information. And that's why I got you this one. To allow you to add some structure as you like and post it after you've had time to construct it as you want it to be.

## Editing

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MasterBrian/masterbrian.github.io/edit/gh-pages/_posts/2020-12-08-github-pages.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Or use any device that has A) a text editor, and B) git. I can help you with that if you want.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

I encourage you to click into the editor link and play around with the posts. Once you get a feel for the format, you're more than welcome to delete this Welcome post (or any others I started as demonstration), as you won't really need those.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MasterBrian/masterbrian.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

I chose a default theme for you (Cayman), but have since updated it to provide a more personal look and feel. If you try to change the theme, it will almost defnitely break things. Let me know if you want anything to look a little different and I can work on that.

### Support or Contact

I will message you credentials to access your account. Feel free to change those if you want. Your official domain also comes with an email account that I'll link you to. Let me know if you have any issues or your want to change anything. I haven't had time to fully learn the system, but I know enough to customize it. 

For official support or anything you want to check out yourself there is [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) available through Github.
